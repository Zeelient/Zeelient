- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Zeelient, but call me Zeel. Trying to improve my coding skills and get any coding job by learning and practicing many computer languages.
- This account will act as a portfolio for most of my stuff. I'm open collaborations, internships, and jobs. Currently, I have learned HTML, CSS, JS, c++, Java, Python, and mySQL.
